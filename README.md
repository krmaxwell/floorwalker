floorwalker
===========

Floorwalker is a simple Pastebin mirroring and searching tool. It will run until you tell it to stop, grabbing one paste every 2 seconds with a small additional delay between grabs of pastebin.com/archive.

Requirements: [BeautifulSoup4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) (and soon SQLite3).
